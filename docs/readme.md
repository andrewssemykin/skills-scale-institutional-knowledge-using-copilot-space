# OctoAcme — Project Management Overview

This folder contains OctoAcme's core project management process guidance. Use this README as a concise entry point to help teams find the right process documents and understand our ways of working.

Purpose
- Centralize repeatable project practices and reduce single-person knowledge risk.
- Provide a quick orientation to roles, artifacts, cadence, and where to find detailed docs.

Key principles
- Customer-first: prioritize measurable customer value.
- Iterative delivery: ship small, testable increments.
- Clear ownership: each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead.
- Data-informed decisions: validate with metrics.
- Psychological safety: encourage feedback and learning.

Core roles
- Product Manager (PdM): defines outcomes and success metrics.
- Project Manager (PM): coordinates delivery, risks, and communications.
- Developers: implement and test features.
- QA / Testing: validate acceptance criteria.
- Stakeholders: provide inputs and approvals.

Primary artifacts (quick)
- Project One-pager / Charter
- Roadmap & Release Plan
- Sprint backlog & acceptance criteria
- Risk register
- Retrospective notes & action items

High-level lifecycle
1. Initiation — define problem, stakeholders, and success metrics.
2. Planning — create backlog, estimate, and map milestones.
3. Execution — build, test, review, iterate.
4. Release — deploy, verify, and announce.
5. Close & Retrospective — capture learnings and action items.

How to use this folder
- Start with the Project One-pager in the initiation doc for new projects.
